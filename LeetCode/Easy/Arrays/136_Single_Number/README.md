# 136. Single Number – Java Solution

This repository contains a Java solution for the **LeetCode problem: Single Number**.

The solution identifies the element that appears exactly once in the array while all other elements appear twice, using a **brute-force comparison approach**.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Given a non-empty integer array `nums`, every element appears twice except for one.  
Find and return the element that appears only once.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Initializes a variable to store the final answer  
- Handles the edge case where the array has only one element  
- Uses two nested loops to compare each element with all others  
- Skips comparison when both indices are the same  
- If an element does not match with any other element, it is identified as the single number  
- Returns the unique element immediately once found  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Conditional statements  
- Brute-force comparison  
- Early return optimization
